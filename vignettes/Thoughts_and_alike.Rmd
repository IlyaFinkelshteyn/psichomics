Another thing I have considered is that maybe it'd be best if we used always the
same name for functions belonging to different modules but that doesn't work in
R since each function needs to have its own different name. Another way we maybe
could  accomplish this is by using classes instead. Maybe two methods with the
same name in different classes are allowed? They are definitely allowed in
different environments (creating a list of environments is currently the way
dealt with them.)

parsed)... or better yet, parse all different event types (just using split
should be easy, no?)
