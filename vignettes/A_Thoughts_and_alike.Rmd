Another thing I have considered is that maybe it'd be best if we used always the
same name for functions belonging to different modules but that doesn't work in
R since each function needs to have its own different name. Another way we maybe
could  accomplish this is by using classes instead. Maybe two methods with the
same name in different classes are allowed? They are definitely allowed in
different environments (creating a list of environments is currently the way I
deal with them).

## Reading data

Reading data should be as fast as possible.
There are two packages that are very fast loading files: `readr` and
`data.table`.

Compared to fread, readr:
* is ~1.2-2x slower. For best performance, use data.table::fread()
* readr has a slightly more sophisticated parser, recognising both doubled
("""") and backslash escapes ("""); readr allows to read factors and date times
directly from disk
* fread() automatically guesses the delimiter, header, lines to skip by default
and more; readr asks for these
* readr is designed to be general, and dealing with new types of rectangular
data just requires implementing a new tokenizer; fread() is designed to be as
fast as possible; fread() is pure C, readr is C++ and Rcpp

Using readr to load a big junction quantification file from BLCA Firehose
cohort took 30 seconds vs fread's 13 seconds.
