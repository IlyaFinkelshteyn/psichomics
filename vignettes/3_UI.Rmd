# Conditional panels VS renderUI

It seems that renderUI has a problem that conditionalPanel do not: when trying
to reload the same code, renderUI reloads everything, not loading any previous
state from the user. On the other hand, conditionalPanel does save and restores
the objects state when reloading the same section. The only drawback to
conditionalPanel is that it the condition must be a JavaScript expression while
renderUI is all in R.
